                    Hello! I am currently a term 6 Computer Engineering student at
                    Memorial University of Newfoundland, where I am
                    expecting to graduate in April of 2023. I'm currently completing
                    my fourth work term as a software engineering student
                    at <a className={Main.mainLink} href="https://getmysa.com/?country=CA">Mysa Thermostats</a>. Before that, I
                    had the opportunity to work on Nokia's SAM software in Ottawa. 
                </p>
                <p className={Main.desc}> 
                    I love problem solving and getting to work on projects that can influence a large
                    number of people. I also love learning about newer technologies, and trying to apply
                    what I've learned into my own projects. The idea behind this website is to serve as an online resum√© 
                    that will hopefully be a bit more interesting to look at than a black and white sheet of paper!
                </p>
